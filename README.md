## FAQ

> Is Gitnuro completly free?

Yes, free in both meanings of the word (in money and freedom).

> Does Gitnuro keep track of my data?

Gitnuro does not track data in any way, don't worry.

> I don't like the built-in themes, can I create a custom one?

Gitnuro includes the option to set custom themes in a JSON format. Keep in mind that themes may break with new releases,
making the default theme the fallback option.

For the latest stable version, you can use this JSON as an example:

```
{
    "primary": "FF456b00",
    "primaryVariant": "FF456b00",
    "onPrimary": "FFFFFFFFF",
    "secondary": "FF9c27b0",
    "onBackground": "FF141f00",
    "onBackgroundSecondary": "FF595858",
    "error": "FFc93838",
    "onError": "FFFFFFFF",
    "background": "FFe7f2d3",
    "backgroundSelected": "C0cee1f2",
    "surface": "FFc5f078",
    "secondarySurface": "FFedeef2",
    "tertiarySurface": "FFF4F6FA",
    "addFile": "FF32A852",
    "deletedFile": "FFc93838",
    "modifiedFile": "FF0070D8",
    "conflictingFile": "FFFFB638",
    "dialogOverlay": "AA000000",
    "normalScrollbar": "FFCCCCCC",
    "hoverScrollbar": "FF0070D8",
    "diffLineAdded": "FF0070D8",
    "diffLineRemoved": "FF0070D8",
    "isLight": true
}
```

Colors are in ARGB Hex format.

> Why isn't the Mac version signed?

The cost of the Apple Developer Program is quite high with a platform that currently has very few users. I may pay for
it if it's a very requested feature but not for now.

> Authentication has failed. What's wrong?

Currently there are some limitations regarding this topic. Here are some known problematic setups:

- Multicast DNS remote URL (https://github.com/JetpackDuba/Gitnuro/issues/19) with this
  workaround (https://github.com/JetpackDuba/Gitnuro/issues/19#issuecomment-1374431720).
- Self signed server certificate (https://github.com/JetpackDuba/Gitnuro/issues/48)

If the authentication fails and you think its due to a different reason, please open a new issue.


> Does it support Git credentials manager (aka manager-core)?
> Yes but it requires specifying the full path of the binary in your `.gitconfig`.

Example for linux:

```
[credential]
   helper = /usr/share/git-credential-manager-core/git-credential-manager-core
```

Example for windows (you may want to edit `C:\Program Files\Git\etc\gitconfig`):

```
[credential]
   helper = C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin/git-credential-manager-core.exe
```
